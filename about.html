  <h2>About Four Bean Soup</h2>
  <p>
    Four Bean Soup is the family company built by Josh Owens and Wendy Owens.  We build tasty web apps that we need and want to use.  We value our time, we like to spend it with our family - so we build tools that help us save time and accomplish the things we need to.

  <p>
    We try to run our company the same way we run our home.  Our children are taught honesty and to treat people with respect.  As a company we try our best to set a good example with similar values.  We can't always be perfect but we can do our best and own our mistakes.
